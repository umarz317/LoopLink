# Credits and license notices

## Receiver

LoopLink is a fork of [DiPlay by shihabal3amri](https://github.com/shihabal3amri/DiPlay), which is a modified version of [xcertplay by shilapi](https://github.com/shilapi/xcertplay). The upstream receiver is licensed under GNU GPL version 3; the full text is in `LICENSE` and the original README is retained in `docs/UPSTREAM-README.md`.

Upstream credits [LIVI](https://github.com/f-io/LIVI) and [Showcase](https://github.com/amineross/showcase) for protocol research. Existing source comments and attribution are preserved.

## Home and settings UI

DiAuto's source is licensed under AGPL version 3. The UI file is marked AGPL-3.0-only; its license text is included in `docs/licenses/DiAuto-AGPL-3.0.txt`.

## Experimental authentication data

The public preview APK includes an accessory certificate/key pair recovered from public Carlinkit C2Air Allwinner V821 firmware during the owner's local investigation. These data are not newly generated Apple-issued credentials for DiPlay or LoopLink and are not relicensed as project source code. They are bundled in the preview APK to reproduce the offline experiment; continued acceptance and suitability for general distribution are unresolved. The source archive does not contain the private key, and the separate Android APK-signing key is never distributed.

## Download website

The static site layout, CSS and generator adapt DiAuto (AGPL-3.0). The AGPL license text is included with the source.

## Branding and trademarks

The LoopLink name and logo (`asset/looplink-logo.svg`, `asset/looplink-mark.svg` and the app icons made from them) belong to the LoopLink project. CarPlay and iPhone are trademarks of Apple Inc.; LoopLink is not an Apple-certified product and no Apple affiliation or endorsement is implied.
